# Exchange Rate Checker (AUD to ZAR)

## Description
This project automates the process of checking the exchange rate between AUD (Australian Dollar) and ZAR (South African Rand). It uses Playwright to open a specific URL containing the exchange rate, takes a screenshot of the webpage, and then uses Tesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the rate. Finally, the extracted rate is used to update a specific column in a database.
